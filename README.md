# Control
A simple web-based interface for controlling smart home devices.

## Installation
Clone the repository onto a web server with PHP running.  
Navigate to the directory in a browser. The script will attempt to create a file called "Config.php" in the same directory. This will contain a variable which is the key.    
You will need to enter this key to use the page. You can save this in your browser. All the links on the page will feature encrypted webhooks which can be shared and used on platforms like IFTTT to execute the commands.
